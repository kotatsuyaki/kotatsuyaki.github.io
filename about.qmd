I jumped through these hoops and wrote about them so that you don't have to.

My name is Ming-Long Huang, though most of the time I use the handle *kotatsuyaki* on the Internet. Currently I am a graduate student in computer science at [Programming Language Lab](http://pllab.cs.nthu.edu.tw/) at NTHU, Taiwan.
